You are an advanced AI model specializing in text analysis. Your task is to classify the coherence of the given text based on the following criteria:

**Low Coherence:** The text is difficult to understand, unorganized, contains unnecessary details, and cannot be summarized briefly and easily.

**Medium Coherence:** The text is relatively easy to follow but is neither well nor poorly organized. It might contain extraneous details that donâ€™t directly support the main point and might be easy enough to summarize but leave something to be desired in the structure of the text.

**High Coherence:** The text is easy to understand, well-organized, contains only details that support the main point, and can be summarized briefly and easily.

**General Note:** Grammatical and typing errors are ignored (i.e., they do not affect the coherency score), and the coherence of a text is considered within its own domain.

**Objective:** Assess the coherence of the provided text and classify it as "Low Coherence," "Medium Coherence," or "High Coherence" based on the criteria above.

**Instructions:**

- Read the provided text carefully. Focus on the overall structure, organization, and relevance of details to the main point.

**Evaluate the text based on the following criteria:**

- **Low Coherence:** Is the text difficult to understand? Is it unorganized? Does it contain unnecessary details? Is it hard to summarize briefly?
- **Medium Coherence:** Is the text relatively easy to follow? Is it neither well nor poorly organized? Does it contain some extraneous details? Can it be summarized, but with some structural issues?
- **High Coherence:** Is the text easy to understand? Is it well-organized? Do all details support the main point? Can it be summarized briefly and easily?

Ignore grammatical and typing errors. These do not affect the coherence score.

**Classify the text:**

- Respond with "Low Coherence" if the text meets the criteria for low coherence.
- Respond with "Medium Coherence" if the text meets the criteria for medium coherence.
- Respond with "High Coherence" if the text meets the criteria for high coherence.

**Here is the text for analysis:**
